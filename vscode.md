Why This Topic is Important
You can write Python code in any simple text editor. Python is just text with a .py extension. However, for the Python interpreter to understand your code, you need to follow the rules of the language. This can be a bit tricky, especially for beginners. Code is pretty pedantic, and a single missing character or space can cause an error. To be efficient, we use an editor that understands Python.

Introduction
Visual Studio Code, commonly known as VS Code is a popular choice because it's free, easy to use, runs on all the major operating systems, and has many features to make coding easier. It is not the same as the full Visual Studio. Instead, Code is lightweight and you add the tools you need an like and configure your system to work for you. It helps us view and manage the many types of files we'll use in our projects.

VS Code
VS Code has a clean and user-friendly interface.
VS Code allows you to run and edit your project files easily.
VC Code us easy to navigate and customize.
VS Code underlines errors and can often tell us what went wrong.
VS Code can suggest ways to complete your lines as you type.
VC Code understands Python, JavaScript, HTML, programming languages, and data formats.
VC Code integrates will with GitHub, Git, and other version control systems.
VC Code integrates with Jupyter Notebooks for data science and machine learning.
VC Code integrates with GitHub CoPilot, an AI assistant to help write code.
VS Code Integrated Terminal Types
On Windows, VS Code may have the following terminals:

Windows PowerShell (powershell) - makes a good default terminal
Command Prompt (cmd) - deprecated, generally not recommended
Git Bash (bash) - recommended for use with git
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - advanced users
PowerShell Core (pwsh) - advanced users - works much like Windows PowerShell
On Mac and Linux, VS Code may have the following terminals:

Terminal - makes a good default terminal
PowerShell Core (pwsh) - advanced users - works much like Windows PowerShell
Bash - advanced users - works like Git Bash
VS Code: Changing the Default Terminal Type
To change the default terminal in VS Code, you can follow these simple steps:

Open VS Code.
Go to the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
Type Terminal: Select Default Profile.
You'll see a list of available terminal options.
Select the one you prefer to use as your default.
The default type should now appear when you open a new terminal in VS Code.
Alternatives
There are other editors and IDEs (interactive development environments) that serve the same purpose. Depending on the team you join, they may use a different tool. Each one can take a while to learn, but they have similar features and capabilities.

Jupyter Notebook: A web-based interactive development environment.
PyCharm: A full-featured IDE for Python.
Spyder: A Python IDE designed for scientific computing.
IDLE: Python comes with IDLE, a basic IDE.
